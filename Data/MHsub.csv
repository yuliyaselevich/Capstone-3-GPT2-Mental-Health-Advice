1663534517,xhrtbf,1,"I don‚Äôt entirely want to reach out to people here on reddit, mostly because I‚Äôm already going through therapy and it‚Äôs quite a convoluted situation as well plus I hate bringing attention to myself.

But to put it simply I‚Äôve been through an incredibly rough depression the last couple of years and I haven‚Äôt even gotten out of it really, I‚Äôve been picking up some good habits as of late and objectively I‚Äôm doing well. I‚Äôve lost 8kgs in 1.5 months with dieting and working out, I‚Äôve isolated myself from all social media and I‚Äôve also been abstaining from alcohol, drugs, and onanism for a while longer. Along with an array of other good habits.

However I just can‚Äôt be happy with myself, even if I can think rationally and objectively about myself, the self-hatred just takes over and takes control of those rational thoughts and throws them out the window. On one hand I don‚Äôt dislike these thoughts to an extent because I find them to be comforting, but it takes control of a major part of my life which mainly revolves around expressing myself and being able to love myself.

I am a creative person with a creative mind and I absolutely love art, but whenever I try to work on it I just hate myself to such an extent that I feel like unaliving myself, even if I know that I need to be a beginner to become an expert. I just can‚Äôt get these penetrating thoughts out of my head.

I‚Äôve talked about this a lot with my therapist but I‚Äôm at a stalemate and she doesn‚Äôt really know how to tackle this and get somewhere with it.
So I‚Äôve come here for an outsider‚Äôs opinion, I know a lot of people that suffer from self hatred have had abusers put those words into their minds but I‚Äôve basically been through nothing in my life so I don‚Äôt know where it came from apart from me imprinting this mindset into myself.

I‚Äôm starting to feel like my boyfriend doesn‚Äôt actually like me. I‚Äôm (21f) and he‚Äôs (21m), we‚Äôve been together for 6 years and I constantly get these feelings of doubt. I do believe my bf loves me, but I don‚Äôt think he likes me. I think the strongest part of our relationship is the sex, and I have bought up to him that I feel we don‚Äôt spend quality time together. 

I‚Äôm just going to list off some of the things that creates this doubt: 

-All of the compliments I receive are about my physical appearance. 
-Whenever I speak passionately about something important to me, he accuses me of having a go at him and then turns it into an argument. (For context, I have been sexually assaulted in the past by him on multiple occasions early on in our relationship, so I get very passionate about women‚Äôs rights)
-I am an incredibly anxious person so he uses this as an excuse to not go out. I plan every time we go out. 
-He sits and plays on his phone a lot, and I can see him losing his patience sometimes when I try to speak to him. 
-I really struggled with depression and anxiety, still do, and I lost interest in everything. He got me into playing games and even bought me a pc for my 21st. He loves the game valorant and I wanted to try it for him, I really enjoy it now and we play together. However, every time we play he gets really angry at me and shouts at me. He calls be stupid and annoying when I panic, I don‚Äôt really enjoy playing now bc of it. 
-He‚Äôs never the one to text or call me, I know he ignores my calls and texts a lot. 
-He‚Äôs lazy and doesn‚Äôt want to better himself. I really try my best to push myself out of my comfort zone for the both of us, but he doesn‚Äôt do the same.
-He‚Äôs had a rough year. His grandad died unexpectedly in the middle of the year so he had his dissertation deferred. He didn‚Äôt tell me until 3 weeks before it was due in that he hadn‚Äôt started it. I ended up writing 5,000 words of his 8,000 word essay. As a surprise I booked for us to go away for the week to celebrate his hard work and give him a well earned break. I was hoping he would do something in return and I kept dropping hints about him taking me out for dinner, but it‚Äôs been a month and nothings happened yet. 
-One of his friends has sexually assaulted somebody, but he is still friends with them. I know that he has done the same, but he has told me and shown me that he‚Äôs changed.  
-He shows me affection when he‚Äôs horny, but none after. 
-I go through really low periods, I get flashbacks to the times I‚Äôve been assaulted and I find it incredibly difficult to deal with. When I bring them up to him, we sometimes speak about it and it‚Äôll make me feel better, but other times he‚Äôll get annoyed and tell me not to bring it up. I understand he‚Äôs disappointed in himself, but I constantly have to deal with the trauma from what‚Äôs happened. 
P.s. the times I was assaulted were all before I was 18. The first few times it had happened, I didn‚Äôt even realise it was assault, one of which being when I lost my virginity. When I had realised what was classed as assault I obviously told him. However, there were still occasions when it happened after this.

1663525319,xho0hj,1,"Background: I've been diagnosed with autism and PTSD, but my PTSD is not related to financial trauma. I technically grew up low-income, but as a kid I had no idea how bad the financial situation was. Now, both my parents (who were divorced and struggling financially when I was little) are remarried and are doing pretty well financially. My only real experience with financial hardship has been as an adult when I was working while going to university--at least once or twice a year, there'd be an unexpected expense and I wouldn't be able to buy food for a week or so. And I had some large medical bills that took a long time to pay off, including some surprise bills that I had to fight, which was stressful, but nothing that would warrant this extreme of a response.

I can only describe this feeling as a combination of my worst autism meltdown feelings and a PTSD-like response...except I've gotten control of my autism meltdowns (it's been over a decade since I've had one) and as I've mentioned, my PTSD had nothing to do with finances (and I've made a huge amount of progress in handling that). It's been years since I've even felt the *urge* to have a full-on autism meltdown.

But the other day I was looking for a gym membership and the reviews of just about every gym in my local area are full of horror stories about them not allowing people to cancel their memberships and sending the bills to collections...and it just set me off. I didn't have an outward meltdown (no screaming or punching shit or anything like that) but inside I was absolutely losing my shit and my sensory integration issues got worse I got stuck awake last night. Just *looking* at *other people's* financial problems set me off.

And lately I've been dealing with some large surprise bills that I can't afford but that I am not legally liable for (details irrelevant but I can elaborate in comments if you want) and while I'm trying to be rational about it and go through the proper legal channels to get it resolved, I keep having this dizzying panic accompanied by the kinds of visceral violent fight-or-flight thoughts that I've had in PTSD-related responses in the past--the same kind of logic that made me want to climb out the window of my own apartment because I became convinced that my roommate at the time wanted to kill me. But at least that panic response made *sense*; I have trauma related to people trying to kill me. I don't have trauma related to medical expenses accidentally being coded incorrectly and getting denied by my insurance company. But lately I've been having nightmares about financial problems.

I really need help. This extreme panic response is preventing me from actually doing what I need to do to get these financial issues resolved. I've spent years in therapy and for a long time I was fine with or without it but right now I don't have health insurance and don't make enough money to qualify for the subsidy on marketplace premiums so now that's *another* financial problem that's triggering this panic and becoming a barrier to me actually seeking help about it.

I'm not sure what's going on, she lies about a lot of things, and I've been told I am very patient but also na√Øve about situations, so don't know now if she has lied too much and I am just to naive to understand. Or whether I am looking too much in to it.

I recently about a week or two have been experiencing such tired and full of headaches (center of skull or forehead regions) mornings, constantly making scenarios of verbal defensive or even offensive dialogue with others esp. close siblings over past injustice with me or my close family. 

I feel that it is taking a toll on my health as nothing can be gained from this and justice will not walk on its feet to anybody. I feel its better to move on to higher pastures and new frontiers.

Also, a past depression diagnosis have been made and am fully functional as never before. Hence, am not on any sort of meds.

I wanted to just tell her that she was an asshole but instead, seeing that she seemed like I was scaring her, decided to try to do something more constructive and adult. I simply sent her an audio saying that if I reacted that way is because I had a good feeling about her and I was let down of how she behaved (we matched on tinder, she gave me her number out of the blue and talked a while).

There were a few periods when I went off the drug in my 20s, but after several relapses I just stuck with it.

The past couple of years have been very difficult, but it hadn‚Äôt occurred to me until I started seeing a new MD this year that Celexa just wasn‚Äôt working for me anymore. She started me on Wellbutrin and in August I started a cross taper to slowly go down on Celexa and replace it with Zoloft. Things seemed to be going okay until last week, when I got down to 40mg of Celexa. 

I‚Äôm crying all the time. Sometimes my head feels like it‚Äôs pounding, sometimes I feel stoned when I‚Äôm not.

How does one stop thinking they're not enough, not good enough, not good-looking enough, not kind enough, not smart enough, just... not enough? How do I stop thinking I don't deserve any good thing in my life at all?

I'm seeing two therapists right now, I'm reading books, I'm listening to podcasts, and all I keep hearing is why I feel this way. And I get that now. I've gotten that for months. But how in the world do I stop feeling it? How do I damned change it? Because no matter what I tell myself, what I write down, what I say to people, I keep feeling this way, and it's so damn tiring. I can't keep fighting for myself while not believing in myself, and I want to know how I can finally feel differently about me.

I had an amazing girlfriend, and no matter what, I never seemed to be able to trust her. I know now that it wasn't because she wasn't worthy of my trust, but because I didn't think I was worthy of her. I get that now, and I get why I felt that way, but how do I STOP feeling like that?

I used to be a writer, and one of the reasons I stopped was because I never thought I was good enough, or deserved succes. I get why I felt that way, but I can't fucking STOP feeling that way, and I'm tired of it.

Colon cancer, which is also commonly known as Bowen or Colorectal cancer is by count the third cancerous deformity known to both men and women. From its name, colorectal cancer grows and affects the colon of the human body. In every human, the colon is known to be the largest part of the large intestine. The leftovers from the digested food move through the colon before stopping at the rectum, then down to the anus.

Often, we get patients who never noticed any form of symptoms whatsoever. This is because cancer grows mostly in silence, without sending obvious symptoms to any part of the body. Awareness campaigns have been organized by a few private and public health organizations, to spread the news on colorectal cancer, and its prevention. Aside from raising awareness of colon cancer, these campaign groups have also been out to reduce the stigma colorectal cancer attracts to its patients.

Because of how deadly and sneaky this cancer eats up its victim, the treatment options and procedures have been limited. According to cancer specialists at the Cancer Cancer, America, the treatment options administered to a patient is dependent on the age, the stage at which it has gotten, and cancer's behavior. The cancer treatment include; surgery, chemotherapy, targetted therapy, radiation therapy, and others.

**Eight Early Signs of Colorectal Cancer in Adults**

1663512320,xhijcz,1,"I've been online for 26 years and there were periods once where I was excited, ecstatic and positive to be interactive. I actually couldn't wait sometimes to surf around and explore, to see where I visited and who I talked with within the community.  


But it feels like in the last 10 years, I've been running more and more into, very problematic people and those with intentional maliciousness behind their social natures. It was a gradual downhill progression in how this happened that was based off from community to community.  


I'd always get bullied for the amount of text I type, such as this one. I'd get pegged at for giving honest opinions of something. The harder I fought back, the worse it got to where people plotted against me to have accounts banned or restricted. Gaslighting was everyone's favorite tactic because they know if they rile someone up, it'll be easier to rile them up further with the next bullshit thing they have after.  


And this all wouldn't have been so bad if there were good solid moderators/admins to turn to that'd get rid of this. I would be proven wrong. I've learned from experience, that mods care about withholding integrity of their community about as much as a crooked politician does when in control of their country, state or town. They'll believe the trouble making, instigating, provoking memelords far more than users who're actively being beaten down and dog piled.  


Recently, I deleted an account from an old site I was on because I called out someone who was looking to derail a topic of discussion, for no reason. It sparked an argument, of course, because I ""offended"" the kliq of the site which made things worse. I went on about how in comparison, someone like the individual who derailed the topic, was someone who was given 2nd, 3rd, 4th .etc chances to keep coming back.  


Whereas with someone like me, I get sidelined for 3 years straight and the only way I had to come back, was practically beg through an apologetic note for an incident that I didn't even start with the individuals then. All of which, were still around and undisciplined. The worst part, is the owner of the site who had all of the power at his fingertips, elected to post a meme picture that made a mockery of me in it.  


That's what lead to me to delete my account and I'm not looking back this time. This is the kind of behavior that I've been subjected to, for years. I've grown mutinous towards any moderator and administrator or anyone of authority online because of the times they've deliberately failed me and their positions of authority. When they could've deescalated a situation and handed out neutral discipline to everyone. But no, they centered on me because I was everyone's favorite scapegoat.  


And as for generally anyone online, I grow distrustful. I go by name so if I see someone with '69', dozens of XxXx's in them, '420' or any other cues - I know that's a shitlord who's pretending to be sophisticated. I've had my rounds too with Reddit off and on over the same things, except it's worse because I've had my posts brigaded from people when it was perfectly in tune with the subreddit. Why? Because they feel they can do that, just to serve their power tripping ass.  


I am firmly a believer in that, you give anyone a keyboard and a level of anonymity, you truly can tell how people really are. It would make me respect them less IRL knowing that they're these kinds of people online.",Assholes Online has made me mutinous and distrustful of everyone,1663526720.0,Venting
1663511461,xhi6n0,1,"I'm 20 yrs old, last semester I started attending college in another city about 1 and a half hours away from my hometown (I live in a very small country so this is the furthest you can move away). At first, I couldn't wait, because while I was staying home, I'd always get into fights with my mother and my sister, so I was so excited to finally move out. When I ""moved out"", I'd stay there during the week and I'd come back home for the weekend. Needless to say, it didn't turn out the way I had thought. I hated every moment of it. I had no friends, and I had 4 roommates that were way older than me, so I didn't really feel like I could bond with them. I was so lonely. The second the smallest inconvenience happened, I'd be on the bus omw home. At first I thought, alright, it's just a phase, I will get over it. But no. I was there for about 4 months and I still couldn't bare being away from home. Even though my home isn't such a quiet and peaceful place to live in, I would find being away even more unbearable than living there. I've been home for about 2 months now bc summer break (I have left my house very rarely), but next month I'm gonna have to go again, and I'm having anxiety attacks thinking about it. Anyone reading this would think, but why attend college in another city if you can't bear being away from home.. well the answer is 2 reasons: better education, and I want to finally become independent. I know that moving away is one of the main things I HAVE to do to if I want to have some sort of ""character development"". I don't know what I should do to get rid of this homesickness. The fact that I have struggled with my mental health since the age of 15 is not helping either. I feel so hopeless. I feel like I'm never going to pull through.

1663511095,xhi1ae,1,"So basically I'm preparing for an entrance exam an year from now, and this is my first year out of school now in a coaching institute

Obviously my school acquaintances disconnected, i do talk to my friends in my current classes.

Ok now the main thing, I'm stuck in a weird mental rut , where i try to get my study in, but i end on YT or playing games.

I partially remedied this by deleting all my games, do i can get SOME study in now, but I'd like to do more, mainly because i know i can. 

My brother left for college a month ago and i was pretty damn close to him so that has an effect on me too, although it's lessened with time.

I thought i needed human interaction, so i tried that , it helped a bit but it was more temporary. I tried excercising, which again helped, but only staved off the weird rut for a Little while.

I like watch YT, but i won't feel satisfied at all during or after, i might feel guilty or just plain unfulfilled

Rn , the only thing i can think to do to break this is break my bad grade streak, score an above average grade once to spur on a motivating cycle instead of a demotivating one.

If you've got any tips lmk, mental health professionals are something i considered, but honestly knowin myself i think I can do this myself with some familial support.

I've also been feeling extremely suicidal lately, I can't take this total isolation anymore. Even if I have an opportunity to talk to someone at all, I can barely even manage to form a sentence.

1663510190,xhhnuu,1,"TLDR; My (29) sister (28) claims that she cannot live a fully independent life (financially and personally) due to her schizoaffective disorder. She‚Äôs wants the kind of support from our family that I find is unreasonable.¬†

My (29) sister (28) has been diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder around a year ago and has to take medication. Throughout her whole life she has struggled to maintain school and an independent life. She has always depended on someone in her adult life, be it financial support from our family, boyfriends, or weird random men, and has a bad history of poor decision making. For example, while she was living with her (now ex) boyfriend, I advised that she should money as she was not paying rent and only had to pay for her food. She instead spends thousands of money on cosmetic procedures throughout the two years of the relationship because she says she has body dysmorphia. And when she broke up with that boyfriend, she luckily was able to live in her friend‚Äôs family home while she was finishing up school‚Äî until she got kicked out for being in a relationship with that friend‚Äôs family member even though her family specifically told her they would not like her to be with him (and I also warned her that it‚Äôs better to live there for free than to get kicked out over an extremely new relationship over a college student in his early 20s).¬†

There are several other more poor decisions she has made, but she was also able to depend on the financial help of some random men over the internet since she has done adult entertainment (PG way of saying it) and has an OnlyFans. However, this is not enough o fully support herself financially. Because she got kicked out of that friend‚Äôs house, she is temporarily staying at an AirBnb but has no plans after she finishes school next month. I told her that our stepfather and his wife will let her live there temporarily after school so she can figure her shit out (I am very close to them and they are very kind people who have also let me stay for a bit after graduation). However, because they essentially live in a middle-of-nowhere desert, my sister is very reluctant to take their offer (even though she wouldn‚Äôt have to pay for housing and food).¬†

Some of her ‚Äúfans‚Äù have offered her help, one even offered a free studio apartment for a year and another guy offered her a couch to sleep on. I told her not to easily take these offers and trust them so quickly. I also told her she should try to become financially independent and find her own place to live (even with roommates) but she keeps saying it‚Äôs difficult to do because of her mental health issues. She claims she‚Äôs making these decisions because she has NO ‚Äúfamilial‚Äù support. I asked her if she meant financial (which at this point our parents are not financially support either of us) and while it seems she also wanted some financial help, she also claimed that she just CANNOT live independently at all due to her mental disorder. She stated that she NEEDS someone to making plans for her and execute them. She also stated that our parents ‚Äúshame‚Äù her for her wanting to live being supported.¬†

I‚Äôm just extremely disappointed that that‚Äôs the mindset she convinced herself on.¬† In my opinion this is unreasonable thing to want, especially since our parents are approaching their late 50s and our stepparents are even older (late 60s). I have a deep sense of ‚Äúugh‚Äù on why she‚Äôs also telling me this. We‚Äôre close as siblings but she also knows that I recently landed a job with 6 figure salary in a different state (sadly that info got leaked out). She keeps emphasizing the lack of FAMILIAL support, and I feel that she wants something from me‚Äî be it letting her live with me. This is something I do NOT want AT ALL. She kept telling me how she felt ‚Äúabandoned‚Äù by our family. She communicates a bit with our parents, but she really increases her communication with them once she wants something from them. But she feels that they‚Äôre not giving or helping her enough.

I just don‚Äôt know what to do about this situation anymore. I‚Äôm exhausted and my family is exhausted. I‚Äôve given her advice (that she never follows), and in the past I did give her financial help even though I was struggling as a grad student. She makes ME emotionally drained. I‚Äôm the process of moving to a new state to start a new job, and she barely asks me about my situation, it‚Äôs always about how she‚Äôs so stressed and struggling. A part of me just wants to tell her to straight up ‚Äúdeal with it‚Äù (which I‚Äôve been telling her in a very nice, roundabout way of ‚Äúmaybe you should be financially independent‚Äù).
